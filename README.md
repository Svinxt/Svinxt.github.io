Welcome to **Svinxt.github.io** — my personal GitHub Pages site!  
This repository hosts my portfolio, projects, and experiments across development, design, and automation.

## 🚀 Overview

This website serves as my **digital hub** — a space where I showcase:
- 🔧 Projects I’m currently building or maintaining  
- 🧠 Things I’m learning (from coding to AI tools)  
- 🖥️ Experiments with front-end design, UI/UX, and scripting  
- 📘 Blog posts, tutorials, or personal write-ups  

Built with simplicity and scalability in mind, this site is a continuous work in progress — evolving as I grow as a developer.
